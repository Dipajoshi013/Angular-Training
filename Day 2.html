    <h1>1.Let keyword in js and how it is different for var</h1>
    <p>
      var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript <br />
      but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is
      block scoped.<br />
      Variable declared by let cannot be redeclared and must be declared before
      use whereas variables declared with var keyword are hoisted.
    </p>
    <h2>2.Difference between atribute and parameter.</h2>
    <p>
      The values that are declared within a function when the function is called
      are known as an argument. <br />
      Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are
      known as a parameter.
    </p>
    <h2>3.IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)</h2>
    <p>
      An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function
      that runs as soon as it is defined.<br />
      Advantages of IIFE: <br />
      1. Do not create unnecessary global variables and functions Functions and
      variables defined in IIFE do not conflict with other functions & variables
      even if they have same name. <br />
      2. Organize JavaScript code. <br />
      3. Make JavaScript code maintainable.
    </p>
    <h2> 4.Closure in Js</h2>
    <p>
      Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and
      parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has
      returned. <br> Closure is useful in hiding implementation detail in JavaScript.
      In other words, it can be useful to create private variables or functions.

      // When a variable declared with var is used in a loop, the value of that variable changes.
      var a = 2;
      for (var a = 0; a < 3; a++) {
        console.log("hello");
      }
      console.log(a); // 3
      //The for loop redeclares the variable 'a'. Hence the value of 'a' is changed to 3 at the end.
 

      //When a variable declared with let is used in a loop, the value of a variable does not change.
      let a = 2;
      for (let a = 0; a < 3; a++) {
        console.log("hello");
      }
      console.log(a); // 2
      // for loop treats variable 'a' as a different variable than the one declared above.
      // And the scope of that variable is only inside the for loop. Hence the value of variable 'a' remains 2 at the end.

      //IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
      //We can make any function expression an IIFE by wrapping it in parentheses, and adding a following pair of parentheses at the end:

        var name = "Deeepa";
        console.log(name);
      })();

        function InnerFunction() {
          alert(outerVariable);

      }
