    <h2>1.Java script code is wriiten between script tag.</h2>
    <h2>2.JS is case sensitive language:</h2>
    <p>
      Case Sensitive means that the language keywords, variable, functions names
      , and any other identifiers must be typed with a consistant capitalization
      of letters.for eg. do or DO are diff variable.
    </p>
    <h2>Javascript is Dynamically typed:</h2>
    <p>
      dynamically means type of variable is checked during run time only not at
      a compile time,hence it is also called loosly typed language
    </p>
    <h2>4.Datatype inference in JS:</h2>
    <p>
      Datatype inference means just define the value to the variable that we
      want, and its datatype will be decalared according to the nature of value
      defined.
      
    </p>
    <h2> 5.Var in JS:</h2>
    <p>var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable.
        <strong>Example</strong>
        x=10;
         <br> x is the name of that variable.
         <br> = is the operator that tells JavaScript a value is coming up next.
         <br> 100 is the value for the variable to store.
        </p>
        <p>Var keyword declare both global and local variable.If the var keyword is declared ooutside the function or
          block then it is declared as global variable.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Javascript Hoisting:</h2>
        <p>
          Javascript Hosting means that the Javascript engine moves all the declarations to the top of the script. <br>
        for example we can usse the variable and then we can declare the variable.</p>

    <script>
      //2.Javascript is case sensitive
      var color, COLOR;
      color="red";
      COLOR="green";
      alert (COLOR);

      // 3.Javascript is Dynamically typed:
       var name;
       name= "Deepa";
       alert(name);
       name="13";
       alert(name);

      // 4.Datatype inference in JS:
       var faculty,digit;
       faculty = "Informaeteion Technology";
       digit = 13;
      alert(typeof(digit));
       alert(typeof (faculty));


      //5.Var in Js:
      var name="Dipa"//global variable
      function person(){
        var cast="joshi"   //local variable
        alert(cast);
        alert(name);
      }
      person();
      alert(name);


      //6. javascript Hoisting:
       school="little star"; //name assignment
       alert(school);        //output
       var school;           //Declaration of variable name
